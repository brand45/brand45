## Hi there my name is Brandon, and ever since I was a kid growing up I loved learning 
about computers and how they work.ðŸ‘‹
This has helped me define what I want to do at the University of Illinois at Chicago in pursuit of my cs degree 
where I intend to learn many computer languages that could help me with my goal of my degree.
Iâ€™m currently looking forward to graduation, I have started trying to learn more about C++ and the advantages it comes with, and also want to start learning Java. 
I want to be able to bring my skills to a company that could help me improve them and also sharpen my understanding of languages I have already picked up.
Specialties: C++ ,C
